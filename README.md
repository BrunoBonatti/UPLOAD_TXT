# Project Description

  The aim of this project is to develop a system that allows the user to view a report in ALV Grid format containing the header of accounting documents based on a specific range of documents by company and year. Additionally, upon double-clicking on a header row, the related items will be displayed in a second ALV Grid for a detailed view.

### Key Features

✔️ Display a report in ALV Grid format with the header of accounting documents, filtered by the user-selected company and year range.

✔️ Upon double-clicking on a header row, present the related items for the selected document in a second ALV Grid for a detailed view.

✔️ Handle situations with missing or invalid data: if the user enters nonexistent data within the specified range, an error message should be displayed, allowing the user to correct the field to avoid inconsistencies.
